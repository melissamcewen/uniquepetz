    <h1>Judging Activity Shows</h1>
<p>This guide is a WIP. I've become quite into entering and judging activity shows. You can learn more about them on <a href="https://petz-activity-shows.glitch.me/">Petz Activity Shows</a>. The craft of judging pose shows is quite well established. But how do you judge trick or agility shows? It's a bit more difficult since it's not about doing a particular pose. There is a lot of variety. By nature this type of judging will be subjective to some degree, but I hope this guide will give more of an idea of what I look for.</p>
<h2>What I Look For</h2>
<p>I really look for two things</p>
<ul>
<li>Technique: How well the skills are executed</li>
<li>Presentation: How well the picture is composed</li>
</ul>
<p>I typically arrange the photos on a board and rank them best to worst.</p>
<h2>Rubric</h2>
<p>This is the rubric I use, with Batgirl doing the hoop jump for agility as an example</p>
<h3>Bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Does not perform the skill, for example not catching the frisbee in a frisbee show or ignoring the mouse in a mousing show</li>
<li>Picture missing required elements like the frisbee in the frisbee show</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132275124-3c4f748d-77f0-4e56-b55e-b4733c7e66e3.png" alt="petz49"></p>
<p><em>Batgirl is about to jump through the hoop, but this picture doesn't even show the hoop. She's not jumping. This picture is funny though.</em></p>
<h3>OK</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pet is performing the skill at a basic level</li>
<li>The pet's is not demonstrating their best performance of the skill</li>
<li>The picture is not a good example of the skill</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132275428-9542806e-0834-41e5-9caa-33b849928508.png" alt="petz26"></p>
<p><em>Batgirl is technically jumping through a hoop here, but the picture catches her at an awkward moment. She's barely demonstrating a jump.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132380442-75406ce5-9721-4318-8dea-1e455c0cdafd.png" alt="petz27"></p>
<p><em>Another where Batgirl is technically jumping through a hoop, but it doesn't really show her at her best. She's facing away from the camera. It's not a very good picture in general. It looks strange and awkward. She doesn't really look like she made a successful jump.</em></p>
<h3>Good</h3>
<ul>
<li>The pet is performing the skill in an exemplary manner</li>
<li>The technique demonstrates athleticism</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132275692-c89a0813-2ea2-4ef2-aece-3c4e8674e5e3.png" alt="petz30"></p>
<p><em>Batgirl is showcased mid-jump. She is in an enthusiastic leap through the hoop and the picture showcases that.</em></p>
<h3>Excellent</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is as good as it gets, the pet looks like they have completely mastered the skill</li>
<li>The pet appears to have balance, confidence, and poise</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e5179114876eaff02a5ad17490595044/35c6f528" alt=""></p>
<p><em>In this picture, Batgirl looks more confident than the &quot;good&quot; one. Her facial expression seems more enthusiastic. The jump looks more graceful and balanced. The pose shows off her athleticism.</em></p>
<p>Of course everyone has their preferences. Like some judges might think the leap in the &quot;Good&quot; Batgirl picture is the paragon of good hoop jumping. And with Batgirl just the way her face looks can be a challenge since sometimes she looks horrified when she's happy. Haha.</p>
<h2>Trick show Examples</h2>
<p>With Boris!</p>
<h2>Bad</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132381665-6ff681f2-b6f3-4a94-9b29-940b631ddf25.png" alt="petz24"></p>
<p><em>Is she even doing a trick? I can't tell.</em></p>
<h2>OK</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132381734-34e2dcd0-1495-4905-b3c7-4cfc2bfba608.png" alt="petz17"></p>
<p><em>She is doing a trick, but I can't really easily tell what trick it is from this picture.</em></p>
<h2>Good</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132382308-d9ff0501-eb10-45a5-8399-ea5e15b51cea.png" alt="petz12"></p>
<p><em>I can easily tell this is the &quot;Circle Jump&quot; trick. She looks slightly uneven though.</em></p>
<h2>Excellent</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132382480-5a30b169-1803-4b5f-b021-d25b3bd38d07.png" alt="petz11"></p>
<p><em>Now here it gets more subjective. This is also clearly &quot;Circle jump&quot; but to me she appears more athletic and balanced.</em></p>
<p>But in general I'm not sure this is the best trick for her. I usually use the &quot;Speak&quot; trick when I enter her in trick shows. I think &quot;Speak&quot; really showcases her personality and best traits better than the &quot;Circle jump.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132383486-05c07621-a6bf-43b2-954c-a7cd9260c4e2.png" alt="petz22"></p>
<p>However, I think her neck looks a little strange. So I might try to teach her some new tricks that are a bit more flattering. Tricks is about training, getting a good picture, and choosing the trick that looks best for your pet.</p>
<h2>Mousing Show Examples</h2>
<p>With Big Brain Time</p>
<h2>Bad</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132394311-a71f4e43-68eb-4153-88f0-4fb92c95f20e.png" alt="petz260"></p>
<p><em>The mouse isn't in the picture. Her eyes are also closed.</em></p>
<h2>OK</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132394374-cb03b7dc-0bd6-4429-9c1b-fe406fdfebf7.png" alt="petz114"></p>
<p><em>It looks like she's about to balance on the mouse, but the picture caught her in an awkward moment.</em></p>
<h2>Good</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132394561-f52ce1dc-9886-45eb-b0a7-4d7bbce1d174.png" alt="petz98"></p>
<p><em>This is pretty good. She looks engaged and ferocious. She's showing off the mouse she caught. BUT see the excellent example for how it could be better.</em></p>
<h2>Excellent</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132394550-ae7e0006-d489-4476-89f1-679923b9a60c.png" alt="petz101"></p>
<p><em>This picture is almost the same as the &quot;Good&quot; one but is just a better shot since it shows both ears.</em></p>
<h2>Cat Frisbee</h2>
<p>This is a WIP as <a href="https://petzforum.proboards.com/thread/70446/proposal-catz-frisbee-shows?page=1&amp;scrollTo=773671">cat frisbee shows</a> are new. Featuring Gatsby.</p>
<h2>Bad</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132394997-e191c127-077d-476f-a09f-ecdc901ea98d.png" alt="petz74"></p>
<p><em>Cool shot but he did not catch the frisbee</em></p>
<h2>OK</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132395080-284e40e5-c189-422a-8129-09161d0fe0a5.png" alt="petz135"></p>
<p><em>He caught the frisbee but otherwise this is pretty mediocre. It doesn't convey much action and doesn't show off Gatsby very well</em></p>
<h2>Good</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132395206-789bfe97-4835-48f6-8ab6-4d4d6716880a.png" alt="petz136"></p>
<p><em>A better shot of the catch above. You can see more of Gatsby.</em></p>
<h2>Excellent</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132395265-939e0b04-b142-4b0b-88ba-d3db47952d94.png" alt="petz139"></p>
<p><em>This is slightly awkward but I think that's balanced out by the enthusiasm, action, and athleticism that this picture conveys.</em></p>
