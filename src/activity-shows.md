# Judging Activity Shows
This guide is a WIP. I've become quite into entering and judging activity shows. You can learn more about them on [Petz Activity Shows](https://petz-activity-shows.glitch.me/). The craft of judging pose shows is quite well established. But how do you judge trick or agility shows? It's a bit more difficult since it's not about doing a particular pose. There is a lot of variety. By nature this type of judging will be subjective to some degree, but I hope this guide will give more of an idea of what I look for. 

## Scoring
For each scoring category, I arrange the pictures on a board from first (best) to last. The best picture gets 5 points, 2nd best gets 4 points and so on. 

## Categories
I really look for two things
- Technique: How well the skills are executed
- Presentation: How well the picture is composed


### Technique
This is the rubric I use, with Batgirl doing the hoop jump for agility as an example

#### Bad Technique
 - Does not perform the skill, for example not catching the frisbee in a frisbee show or ignoring the mouse in a mousing show
 - Picture missing required elements like the frisbee in the frisbee show 

Example:

*Batgirl is about to jump through the hoop, but this picture doesn't even show the hoop. She's not jumping. This picture is funny though.*

#### OK Technique
- Pet is performing the skill at a basic level
- The pet's is not demonstrating their best performance of the skill
- The picture is not a good example of the skill

Example: 

![petz26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132275428-9542806e-0834-41e5-9caa-33b849928508.png)

*Batgirl is technically jumping through a hoop here, but the picture catches her at an awkward moment. She's barely demonstrating a jump.*

#### Good Technique
- The pet is performing the skill in an exemplary manner
- The technique demonstrates athleticism 

Example:

![petz30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1251094/132275692-c89a0813-2ea2-4ef2-aece-3c4e8674e5e3.png)

*Batgirl is showcased mid-jump. She is in an enthusiastic leap through the hoop.*

#### Excellent
- This is as good as it gets, the pet looks highly skilled
- The pet appears to have confidence and grace

Example:

![](https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0636492c96cc6fb04cf789492280161d/63403359)

*Unfortunately it's difficult to get a picture of Batgirl that captures this quality. Shambles here is caught in what looks like to me, the most graceful part of a jump. He looks balanced and confident.* 

Of course everyone has their preferences. Like some judges might think the leap in the "Good" Batgirl picture is the paragon of good hoop jumping. I think the mid-jump arc looks much more graceful. 

### Presentation
I'm unsure about whether I will keep judging on this. This is basically the composition and quality of the picture itself. Is it balanced? Does it show off the pet's good qualities? With trick shows this can be a matter of choosing the right trick where the pet looks their best.
