# Judging Activity Shows
This guide is a WIP. I've become quite into entering and judging activity shows. You can learn more about them on [Petz Activity Shows](https://petz-activity-shows.glitch.me/). The craft of judging pose shows is quite well established. But how do you judge trick or agility shows? It's a bit more difficult since it's not about doing a particular pose. There is a lot of variety. By nature this type of judging will be subjective to some degree, but I hope this guide will give more of an idea of what I look for. 

## Scoring
For each scoring category, I arrange the pictures on a board from first (best) to last. The best picture gets 5 points, 2nd best gets 4 points and so on. 

## Categories
I really look for two things
- Technique: How well the skills are executed
- Presentation: How well the picture is composed
