# Weird Babyz
I didn't have Babyz when I was a kid so I decided to try it out recently. I hexed these experimental and weird Babyz. Hexing Babyz is a bit challenging because there is no viewer/visual editor like Petz Workshop. I get distracted easily and so none of these are really finished to my satisfaction. 

## Bonzi Baby
This is supposed to look like Bonzi Buddy, a piece of crapwhere from the same era as Babyz. I wanted to make the feet more gorilla-like but gave up. You're welcome to finish Bonzi Baby for me.

## David
I tried to make the baby from Eraserhead. The whole file is a mess but you're welcome to adopt this poor creature or finish it.
