These are just oshies with Scottish fold ears! Gen-10-8 is NIB but only has one copy of the fold gene. Gen 11-1 is inbred but has two copies. They were bred with the [Swallowtail oshie OW](https://silverfish-swallowtail.weebly.com/download.html) because I was bored. If you have P4 I you'll need a Scottish fold breedfile.
