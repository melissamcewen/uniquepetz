### Cusith (2002)

These were created circa 2002/2003 in Petz 5\. I backported them to Petz 4 recently and also made sure they actually breed true (they originally didn't lol) and have dark eyelids. They are floppy (dali) eared danes with dali personalities. Original description:

> "The Cusith is my third selective breed. I know Floppies/Hounds have been around for awhile, but as far as I know have never been done as a formal selective breed and have always been rather difficult to breed. The Cusith is named after an enormous hound of the Scottish Highlands."
