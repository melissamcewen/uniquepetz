# "Foxes"
I wanted to see how close I could get to a "fox" using genexing. This was also the first time I tried hexing the personality genes. Each is a bit more scared thanks to low confidence. But also very naughty and very acrobatic! The dogz one is more "catlike" and the catz one is more "doglike."

Both use P5 breeds. The Catz has Egyptian Mau ears and the Dogz has a GSD face, so if you're using P3/4 you'll need those breed files.
