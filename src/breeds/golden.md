# Golden Retriever Re-imagined
The Petz 5 Golden Retriever is essentially a lab with some modifications. I wanted something a bit more fluffy so this is what I came up with. The breed was started as a traditional selective breed and finished as a genexed breed so it is higher gen than most of my genexed breeds. I couldn't decide on which coat worked best so I did two versions!
