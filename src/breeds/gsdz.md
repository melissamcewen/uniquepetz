# German Shepherd
I really like the face of the P5 German Shepherd and it's not particularly easy to recreate anything like it with the P3/4 breeds so I did two versions. One with the P5 breed and one without.

### V1: GSDZ
This is a selective breed with some genexing. It really doesn't look much like a real German Shepherd LOL but this is as close as I could come with the original breeds.

- Ears: Chihuahua
- Head: Great Dane
- Body: Labrador
- Legs: Labrador
- Feet: Labrador
- Tail: Sheepdog (long)
- Coat: Sheepdog

### V2: German Shepherd v2
This is the P5 German Shepherd with parts from a few other breeds. I quite like this especially for breeding as I'm not fond of the German Shepherd ears on other breeds for example. This breed is low gen and completely genexed. Requires the German Shepherd breed in Petz 3/4.

## V3: GSDZ with P5 Face
If you want the GSD face without the breeding chaos of the GSD markings/coat (which can mutate very strangely), this pair is useful!
