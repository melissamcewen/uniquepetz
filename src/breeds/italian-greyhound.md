I thought it might be fun to try to replicate IRL breeds with the original PF Magic breeds using selective breeding. This is what I came up for with "Italian Greyhound". Dachie head, bulldog ears, dali body/coat, great dane legs/feet/tail. They should breed true but watch out for random mutations that might cause bicolors to show up due to random mutations + daschie head. I used some of [Vickie's original Italian Greyhound breed](https://web.archive.org/web/20011212080032fw_/http://www.geocities.com/gaealunavenus2/) as a foundation. Vickie was a Petz hexer/selective breeder and her guides taught me so much back in the 00s.
