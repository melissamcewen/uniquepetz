I quite like the P5 Jack Russell Terrier except for the mouth which looks a bit off and the very triangular ears.

## P5 Jack Russell Terrier Reimagined

These are essentially the same as the original except I swapped the head with a dali head and the ears with bulldog ears. Requires Jack Russell Terrier breedfile in P3/4.

## JRTish

The JRTish uses no P5 breeds, just P3/4 breeds. I was aiming for a more wirehaired terrier. So it has the same dali head/bulldog ear as the reimagined version. For coat, tail, and body I used the scottie. Legs and feet are dali. And for markings I used spotless dali markings.
