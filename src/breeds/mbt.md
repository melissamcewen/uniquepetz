# Miniature Border Terrier (2002)

These were created circa 2002/2003 in Petz 5\. I backported them to Petz 4\ but if you play with them in Petz 4 you'll need the Jack Russell Terrier breed (I recommend the [reverie file](http://jewellz.net/)). Original description:

> "The Miniature Border Terrier was bred from golden retrivers, german shepherds, JRTs, scotties and dalis. They are small terrier like dogs that enjoy having fun. "

## Updated Version
This updated version is genexed so it does not require the P5 Jack Russell Terrier. Instead it has mutt ears and a dalmatian head.
