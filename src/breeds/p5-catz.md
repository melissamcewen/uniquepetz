# P5 Catz Reimagined

<img srcset="/public/images/p5catz.png 2x">


I quite like many of the Petz 5 Catz breeds, so for this part of the project, I mainly just genexed out some traits that I prefer not to breed with. This has an advantage in that you don't have to worry about whether your breed files in use are "fixed" or not, because these don't carry the traits that usually need to be fixed like:

- textures on Honeybear, Scottish Fold, Lynx, Mau
- untextured markings on Bobtail

In addition I genexed in traits I found desirable and fun. The most changed breed is the Scottish Fold which only carries the ears of the original because I just didn't want the rest of it. For P4 these will require the converted P5 cat breedfiles.
