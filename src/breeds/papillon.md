# Papillons
It's hard to make anything that looks even a little like a papillon from just P3/4 breeds but I made what I called a "pappish" that is a papillon in spirit if not form. Then I tried to see what I could do with the original P5 papillon with genexing

## P5 Papillon Reimagined

For this I kept the original head and markings. I replaced the tail with a fluffy long sheepdog tail, kind of like the Black Mist fixed file from way back. The coat is a luxurious poodle coat. And the rest is chihuahua. Then as a final touch they are minis! Requires papillon breedfile in P3/4.

The Pappish uses no P5 breeds, just P3/4 breeds. I wanted something fluffy, with big ears, and bicolor with as much white as I could get. They don't look much like real papillons but they are cute!
