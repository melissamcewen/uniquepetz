### Sheepcoat (2021)
These are a bit of a gimmick because they as far as I know the first NIB (not inbred) selective breed. The catch is they are pretty simple (just basically dalmatians with sheepdog coats) and if you breed them together they will be inbred. However, they might be good for breeding projects.
