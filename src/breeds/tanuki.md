# "Tanuki"

I actually wanted to make a raccoon. There is a bug with the German Shepherd breed that sometimes makes funny patterned tails like a raccoon but then I realized I could only do certain colors with it. The colors are limited to those in the GSD markings, so gold and cream. So I made a tanuki instead! A tanuki is sometimes called a "raccoon dog" and this is literally a raccoon dog. Tom Nook from the game Animal Crossing is a tanuki.

They are personality hexed to be slightly less doglike and also quite naughty and serious!

They should breed true but if you're using a "fixed" GSD OW you might lose the markings.
