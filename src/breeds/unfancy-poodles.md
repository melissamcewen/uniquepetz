I love Petz poodle behavior but with poodle "pet cut". These puppies have poodle behavior and the appearance of poodles except they have dali ears and scottie heads. Also useful for breeding labradoodles and other types of dogs without worrying about the puppies having partial poodle cuts (the poodle cut area on top of poodle heads).
