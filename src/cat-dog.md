# Adding a cat gene to a dog! - Draft

I'll add more to this page later but here is a quick and dirty video on doing this technique. It allows you to use cat textures on a dog file without the use of any external texture files. It uses [Reflet's exciting new Petz Byte program so I don't have to recalculate any checksums!](https://reflettage.wixsite.com/yabiko/download)

The steps are
- adopt a poodle from the AC
- edit the poodle's genes to replace the poodle coat with the tabby coat
- save and recalc checksum with petz byte
- copy the edited poodle and breed it!
- voila! a tabby poodle, but it doesn't look right so you'll need to brex
- you can optionally remove the tabby gene from the final brex so you don't have to worry about it when breeding
