# Genetics of coat colors - WIP
I'd like to document what color slots matter for coat colors. Each "looks chromosome" has 5 slots. Depending on the type of coat, only 1 could be used, or many. And the order can determine what part of the coat gets one color. The tools used include [Gene Poolz](https://reflettage.wixsite.com/yabiko/download). I altered some petz to make sure each slot had a different color to make it easier to determine which slot is used and also to remove the markings since color slots don't affect those.


<aside>In dogz the 5th slot doesn't mutate so if it's a different color from the breed's default it's either bred in (options are limited) or from hexed lineage</aside>

A few breed coats just use the first color slot

- Alley cat (the grey muzzle is a marking)

## Calico
Calicos use all slots except the last (5th). It's not easy to describe where each color goes but hopefully the picture is helpful.

## Dachshund Agouti
Most Dachshunds are solid color but a percentage have a black and brown coat. I call it "agouti" because that's what it's called in real dogs. You'll notice it's common among several dog breeds like pinchers and rottweilers. In Petz it uses three color slots. 

<aside>For this coat, putting the coat as dachshund isn't enough, you need the right random seed. I use 3C 48. </aside>


1. The main body color
2. feet/tail tip
