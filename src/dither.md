# Experiments in dithering

Dithering is using computer algorithms to create the illusion of color depth using a limited palette. The Petz Palette only has 256 colors. Of those colors very few of them are purples or oranges, which is disappointing to me. So I started playing with Dithering. I found a cool web application called [DitherIt](https://ditherit.com/) that allows you to experiment with different dithering algorithms. Adding the 256 Petz colors to it seemed daunting but I scripted it and you can get the palette [in this GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/melissamcewen/4aff07d154107787b2cdff156a459d68). Use "Import" to use it on DitherIt. 

Here are some experiments trying to emulate a bright purple.

Some of them are cool but maybe look pretty eye-hurty.

I later learned to narrow down the colors to the more pleasing ones ([I called this palette "malibu"](https://gist.github.com/melissamcewen/6eef8f19735e963c567a9130578e57e9)) and do some manual dithering (in an app with dither brushes called Pixaki) to create cool effects. I used these as textures to make these fun Petz:
