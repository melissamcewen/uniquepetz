# Genexed Breeds
Genexed Breeds is a term I invented to describe ["genetically engineered"](/genetic-engineering) hexed selective breeds. Feel free to use it for your own projects. Basically, with these petz, genetic hexing was used to speed the process of selective breeding and allow for more creative use of color â€“ colors that would not be possible by just mixing the base breeds. These petz have hexed lineage but will still breed true. 

You can find these on the [breeds](/breeds) page now
