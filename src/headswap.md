# Head Swaps
Using Genexes to swap breed heads

## Persian
The party pack literally no one asked for. A pack of catz that are all persian except for their heads. I did all original P4 breeds + 2 P5 breeds (Honey Bear & Scottish Fold). Use for breeding, brexing, and hexing projects. The BWS one has a mutation but I'm too lazy to redo it.

All the original breeds plus a pug (using Kizmet OW) + a pig (no breed files needed)

## Dachshund
All the original breeds plus three p5 breeds (Kizmet OWs used, will need breedfiles for P4) + a pig (no breed files needed)
