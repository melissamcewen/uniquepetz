It's a cactus Orange Shorthair. Available for trade in variations. It just can't look like the ones above. I based it off a prickly pear but I'd like to make some other types of cacti.

Just simple oshies with [pastylabz](https://github.com/yakrell/pastylabz/) paintball pixel art tattoos and matching colors/textures.
