These are based on a pet I bred that I thought was hilarious. His name is "scammer". He looks like a movie villain. Overwrites the B+W Shorthair breed. Put in resources/catz and rename to B+W Shorthair.

## Large Munsterlander (2000ish)

Created a very long time ago. It's very of its time, I think it was hexed off the border collie file that was popular back then. Dalmatian OW.
