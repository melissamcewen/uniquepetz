# Insane Dogz
According to research on [petz personality traits posted on RKC](https://petzforum.proboards.com/thread/69589/personality-discussion), dogz never have any "insanity". Well until now. I hexed this high insanity dog with random genetics. He's free to download. The only special thing about insane dogz is if you spray them, they will have a bit of a meltdown where they close their eyes and run into the carrying case, knocking out all the toys if it's open. Note if you breed this dog it will pass on the insanity because its personality chromosome is also hexed.
