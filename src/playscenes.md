Purr-fectly angled for scoring skating by distance. Reginald there almost got 3 stars! Just place on the "start" based on how the skateboard is facing. Weird fact I discovered is it seems Petz are less likely to skate if they are full. Petting to reward them seems to make them more likely to skate. With practice most can go the full distance + back! The skateboard was official PF magic DLC for P4, you can get it at [Middle Night](https://kel.rainbow-muffin.org/) under "for you" then "pf.magic downloads"
