Congrats! You've launched a beautiful new Eleventy-powered blog on Glitch. Want to see what makes creating on Glitch magical? Check it out:

* Right now, your site is **live on the web**, with a real URL (a secure HTTPS address!) that updates as soon as you make changes to your site or app.
  + **Try this**: In the Glitch editor, click on the name of your project, and in the menu that opens, select the name of your project and type a new one. Your project will be live at the new address instantly.
* **Add a domain** to your new Glitch project! Just go to the **Tools** menu in the Glitch editor, and click on "Custom Domains"
* Use the **Share** button in the Glitch editor to invite others in to edit your new Eleventy project by typing in their email or their Glitch username
  + **Try this**: Make your code, or even your entire app, private to just those you invite, just by [upgrading your Glitch account](https://glitch.com/pricing)
* Use a **full-powered Linux command line** to manage your new Glitch project. Go to the **Tools** menu in the Glitch editor, and click "Terminal" to peek under the hood.
