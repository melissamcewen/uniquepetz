The Eleventy ecosystem is *huge*! There are [official and community](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) starters for almost any glitch project you can dream up.

The best part is, no matter what starter you use, as long as you set your eleventy app to *generated static site*, you'll be able to take advantage of the feature on Glitch! (someone plz rewrite this)

https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/ - also there are plugins, you could put them into this project

Some next steps you could consider in this project:
* Add a UI library like tailwind
* Use the eleventy image library to optimize your blog images
