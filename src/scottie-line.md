# Unique's NIB Scottie Lines

I decided to breed an NIB hex-free purebred Scottie line. Scotties aren't super popular but I love them! They can be a handful and their high naughtiness and independence makes them hard to pose. But they more than make up for it with funny personalities. 

I've been showing the 7th gen foundation dogs, hoping to get both to SGCh.

## Champion (Ch) Unique's Isle of Iona
Line "Enya" 7th gen: I wanted to breed some NIB cream colored dogz like the "wheaten" IRL scotties. I love how she turned out. The cream color looks great.

## Supreme Grand Champion (SGCh) Unique's Loch Lomond
Line "Conan" 7th gen: This is an all-black line. In addition they have slightly shorter bodies than the "Enya" line. I bred for unusual eye color since I was keeping the black color. Most of the different eye colors in this line are darker browns and beiges. 

## Stamp:
If you've adopted a scottie from me feel free to use this stamp:
