# Unique's Scottie Lines

I decided to breed an NIB hex-free purebred Scottie line. Scotties aren't super popular but I love them! They can be a handful and their high naughtiness and independence makes them hard to pose. But they more than make up for it with funny personalities. 

My goal is to show the 7th gen foundation dogs and then breed some litters from them.

Line "Enya" 7th gen: the cream colored dog. I wanted to breed some NIB cream colored dogz like the "wheaten" IRL scotties. I love how she turned out. The cream color looks great.

Line "Conan" 7th gen: This is an all-black line. In addition they have slightly shorter bodies than the "Enya" line. I bred for unusual eye color since I was keeping the black color. Most of the different eye colors in this line are darker browns and beiges.
