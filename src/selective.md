## Selective Breeds

These files are Petz 4. Do whatever you'd like with them :)


### Corgiz (2021)

I set out to make something that looked a bit like a corgi and this is what I ended up with. These lovable dogz have lab personalities + heads, chihuahua ears, dachshund bodies, scottie legs + feet, sheepdog tails and coat, and some mutt markings.

### Sheepcoat (2021)
These are a bit of a gimmick because they as far as I know the first NIB (not inbred) selective breed. The catch is they are pretty simple (just basically dalmatians with sheepdog coats) and if you breed them together they will be inbred. However, they might be good for breeding projects.

### Italian Greyhoundish (2021)
I thought it might be fun to try to replicate IRL breeds with the original PF Magic breeds using selective breeding. This is what I came up for with "Italian Greyhound". Dachie head, bulldog ears, dali body/coat, great dane legs/feet/tail. They should breed true but watch out for random mutations that might cause bicolors to show up due to random mutations + daschie head. I used some of [Vickie's original Italian Greyhound breed](https://web.archive.org/web/20011212080032fw_/http://www.geocities.com/gaealunavenus2/) as a foundation. Vickie was a Petz hexer/selective breeder and her guides taught me so much back in the 00s.

### Unfancy Poodles (2021)

I love Petz poodle behavior but with poodle "pet cute". These puppies have poodle behavior and the appearance of poodles except they have dali ears and scottie heads. Also useful for breeding labradoodles and other types of dogs without worrying about the puppies having partial poodle cuts.

### Floof Foxes (2021)

I love Catz with smol heads and big floofy bodies so I bred my first Catz selective breed. The foxy colors were a surprise but are totally cute!

### Indie Terriers (2021)

Back in 2000 or so I had a Dogz that kind of looked like these. Sadly I lost her in a hard drive failure but I still remember her fondly. These have Scottie personalities, Sheepie tails, Scottie coats, mutt markings, long awkward legs, and cute big feet.

### Cusith (2002)

These were created circa 2002/2003 in Petz 5\. I backported them to Petz 4 recently and also made sure they actually breed true (they originally didn't lol) and have dark eyelids. They are floppy (dali) eared danes with dali personalities. Original description:

> "The Cusith is my third selective breed. I know Floppies/Hounds have been around for awhile, but as far as I know have never been done as a formal selective breed and have always been rather difficult to breed. The Cusith is named after an enormous hound of the Scottish Highlands."

### Bobtail Hounds (2002)

These were created circa 2002/2003 in Petz 5\. I backported them to Petz 4\. Original description:

> "The Bobtail Hound is my first selective breed and is entirely fictional. The bobtail hound was created with old english sheepdog, scottie, mutt and dachshund blood.""
