# Spiderz

My Spiderz for Petz are loosely based on the popular cartoon, Lucas the Spider. They are a bit different from traditional hexed breeds because they are not meant to be used in a breedfile. Instead, I recommend using the [Spider Kit](https://github.com/melissamcewen/spiderz/) to hex/brex your own.

If you just want a spider to play with, here is Lucas. He's a brexed cat so if you try to breed him you'll just get regular kiteens.
