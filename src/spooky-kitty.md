# Spooky Surprise Kitties!
Spooky kitties are genexed catz that carry a variety of genes, but only black and orange for eye/fur colors. Each spooky pair is selected for cuteness. If you breed them you'll likely get more spooky kitties (non spooky color mutations may occur once in awhile). I recommend breeding with the mutated spot alley and B&W shorthair files for 100% spooky colored kitties.
