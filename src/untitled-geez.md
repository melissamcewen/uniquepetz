# Untitled Geez

A geez based on the goose in a certain game. He's maximum naughtiness and I highly recommend downloading Carolyn's [Honker noises](http://homebody.eu/carolyn/sounds.htm) so you can hear him honk.

This is a bit different from traditional hexed breeds since I never intended this file to be used as a breed. If you'd like to hex your own or create a breed, the lnz is available [in my hex code archive](https://github.com/melissamcewen/hexes/tree/main/Goose).
