# Modern Petz Site Making
The goal of this course is to help the Petz Community with making websites that work better on mobile devices. The traditional way of making Petz websites is to use iframes. Unfortunately many of these designs don't work well on mobile devices. Mobile accounts for about half of web traffic these days. And iframes also make it difficult to link to specific parts of the site (this is often called "permalinking").

This course was created for a private discord but you're welcome to use the resources and DIY!

## Month 1: Design
I'm not a design teacher so the goal here is to give out guidance for creating modern designs that work on phones, tablets, and desktop computers. On Discord, Mouse has offered to help with design! 

### Task 1: Research
Open your phone. What websites do you typically visit on your phone? Take notes about how they are designed. Also how you navigate between parts of the website. Is there a menu? How does it work? 

### Task 2: Mobile design sketch
Mobile gives you way less space for design. But don't worry, with some responsiveness you can get more canvas for decorative elements later. Right now I want you to focus on the mobile canvas. Sketch out your design on paper keeping in mind the shape and size of a mobile device. [If you have a printer you can use these mobile wireframing templates.](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/09/free-download-ux-sketching-wireframing-templates-mobile/). But a really simple way is just trace around your phone on a piece of paper. Some key things to think about:

- How will users navigate your site? Some different simple ideas here on [Three CSS Alternatives to JavaScript Navigation
](https://css-tricks.com/three-css-alternatives-to-javascript-navigation/). If you're looking to do something more advanced you'll need to learn a bit of JavaScript but I'll help you with it. 
- What fonts will you use? Explore different options on [CSS Font Stack](https://www.cssfontstack.com/) and [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- What sections of the page will be the same on all pages of the site? For example, the header or footer. 
- Don't worry about being super precise with your sketch, sometimes even very rough ["fat marker"](https://domhabersack.com/newsletter/fat-marker-sketches-are-the-better-mockups) sketches can help unlock creativity
- What colors will you use? You can even think about a color scheme of complementary colors that work well together. 

You're welcome to post your drafts on Discord for feedback! 

### Task 3: Figma - DRAFT
Figma is a great design tool. The goal here is to learn just enough of the basic Figma tooling to create a simple design. Some things to learn
- frames (specifically device frames)
- text tool
- basic shape tools
- importing images

Start by signing up for Figma and then doing the basic tutorial. Then start trying to mock up your design in Figma. Feel free to ask questions in the Discord channel.
