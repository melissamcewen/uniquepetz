          How to get Petz 4 running on a modern Mac
        </h1>
        <p>
          For years I meant to do this but I always got stuck because most
          instructions for Petz 4 on a Mac use a software called Wine. Wine is
          extremely buggy and I could never get it to run correctly. So recently
          I decided to do something else and finally got it running correctly.
          This all uses free software.
        </p>
        <aside>
          If you're willing to spend money on it, using Parallels is much easier and faster. They offer a free trial if you want to try it out.
        </aside>
        <h2>
          Get VirtualBox
        </h2>
        <p>
          VirtualBox is software that allows you to run virtual machines on your
          computer. Virtual machines are like fake computers that live in your
          real computer. You can download VirtualBox on
          <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">virtualbox.org</a>
        </p>
        <h2>
          Install Windows 10
        </h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://archive.org/details/Windows10Enterprise2016LTSBx86"
            >Grab this Windows 10 iso from Archive.org</a
          >. An iso is like a fake CD rom you can use on your brand new fake
          computer. Then follow the steps in the

            >How to Install Windows 10 on VirtualBox</a
          >
          video. By the end of the video you should have a brand new Windows 10
          VM running on your Mac! Make sure to follow the "Guest Additions" step
          so you can share a folder on your Mac with your Windows VM.
        </p>
        <aside>
          I tried other versions of Windows and most didn't run well in
          VirtualBox. XP for example is really slow and I have no idea why.
          Windows 10 also has a "compatability mode" that allows you to play
          even older games.
        </aside>
      </div>
      <h2>
        Get Petz 4
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are many copies of Petz 4 available online but I like the one
        available
        <a href="https://reflettage.wixsite.com/yabiko/download"
          >on Yabiko, a Petz website.</a
        >
        Put it in a folder on your Mac.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Get the Petz 4 folder onto your Virtual Machine
      </h2>
      <p>
        To get folders from your Mac to your Windows 10 Virtual Machine, you can
        either drag and drop or set up a "shared folder."To enable drag and
        drop, go to "Devices" on the Mac Menu bar while your Windows 10 VM is
        open. Then select "drag and drop" then "bidirectional". Now you can drag
        your Petz folder from your Mac Finder right into the Virtual Machine
        desktop. From your Virtual Machine, open the folder you just dragged and
        click on the Petz game. Enjoy!
      </p>

      <h2>
        Optional: Shared folders
      </h2>
      <p>
        Shared folders are a bit more complicated but allow you to have folders
        that are accessible from both your Mac and inside the Virtual Machine.
        Go to "Devices" on the Mac Menu bar while your Windows 10 VM is open.
        Then click "Shared Folders" and finally into the "Shared Folders
        Options." Click the icon on the right that looks like a folder with a
        plus icon. For "folder path" click on it, select "other", then navigate
        to the folder where you put the Petz 4 game. Click "Open" on the bottom
        of the folder selection window to select it. Open up a Windows Explorer
        window and navigate to "Network". Your shared folders will be in the
        "Vboxsr" folder
      </p>
      <aside>
        You can ignore the other options, but if you want to keep this folder
        attached every time you open the VM, check the "make permanent"
        checkbox. I like to keep at least one shared folder attached because I
        use it to back up my petz and save pictures to. VirtualBox can be buggy
        so I recommend backing up your Petz often.
      </aside>
      <h2>
        Additional tips
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There are now many cool Petz dev tools and utilities (see
          <a href="https://petz.fandom.com/wiki/Tools_and_Software">
            this list on the Petz wiki</a
          >). The Petz 4 copy I recommend comes with Petz A already installed
          which has utilities for breeding petz and trimming large petz files. I
          also really like LNZ Pro for file editing and Petz Pic factory for
          generating pictures from Petz files.
        </li>
        <li>
          Back up your Petz often, especially if you're messing with Petz A or
          other similar tools
        </li>
        <li>
          If your Petz game loses all the toys in playscene, you may need to
          reset the registry using RegEdit. The keys are in
          "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\VirtualStore\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PF.Magic"
        </li>
        <li>
          My Windows 10 Virtual Machine often has mysterious slowness that only
          resolves when I restart my Mac.
        </li>
